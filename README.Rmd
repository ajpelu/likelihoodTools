The likelihoodTools package provides tools for managing and exploring parameter 
estimation results derived from Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) using the 
[likelihood](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/likelihood/index.html) package. This package simplifies analysis workflows by offering 
functions that support the organization, visualization, and summary of MLE 
outcomes, aiding in deeper statistical insights.

## Installation

You can install the development version of likelihoodTools from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ajpelu/likelihoodTools")
```

## Key Features

- Tools for organizing MLE outputs.
- Functions to explore, visualize, and interpret parameter estimation results.
- Integrations with dplyr and ggplot2 for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

## Dependencies
likelihoodTools imports dplyr, ggplot2, and rlang for streamlined data manipulation, plotting, and enhanced compatibility with tidyverse workflows.

## Target Audience
Ideal for statisticians, data analysts, and researchers working with Maximum Likelihood Estimation who seek to streamline their analysis process.
